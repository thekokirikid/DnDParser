		<text>&#8226; The creature has resistance to all damage.</text>
		<text>&#8226; The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.</text>
		<text />

		<text>&#8226; The creature drops whatever it’s holding and falls prone.</text>
		<text>&#8226; The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</text>
		<text>&#8226; Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</text>
		<text>&#8226; Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Exhaustion:</text>
		<text>Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Level &#8212; Effect:</text>
		<text>1 &#8212;Disadvantage on ability checks</text>
		<text>2 &#8212;Speed halved</text>
		<text>3 &#8212;Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws</text>
		<text>4 &#8212;Hit point maximum halved</text>
		<text>5 &#8212;Speed reduced to 0</text>
		<text>6 &#8212;Death</text>
		<text />
		<text>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.</text>
		<text>A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</text>
		<text>An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</text>
		<text>Finishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.</text>
