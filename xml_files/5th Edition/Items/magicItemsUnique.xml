	<item>		<name>Axe of the Dwarvish Lords</name>		<type>M</type>		<weight>4</weight>		<text>Requires attunement</text>		<text></text>		<text>	Seeing the peril his people faced, a young dwarf prince came to believe that his people needed something to unite them. Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that would be such a symbol. </text>		<text>Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the young prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted four great tools: the Brutal Pick, the Earthheart Forge, the Anvil of Songs, and the Shaping Hammer. With them, he forged the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords. </text>		<text>Armed with the artifact, the prince returned to the dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges and answered slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations. </text>		<text>Later, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it. </text>		<text>Magic Weapon: The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The axe also functions as a belt of dwarvenkind, a dwarven thrower, and a sword of sharpness. </text>		<text>Random Properties: The axe has the following randomly determined properties: </text>		<text>&#8226; 2 minor beneficial properties </text>		<text>&#8226; 1 major beneficial property </text>		<text>&#8226; 2 minor detrimental properties </text>		<text>Blessings of Moradin: If you are a dwarf attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits: </text>		<text>&#8226; You have immunity to poison damage. </text>		<text>&#8226; The range of your darkvision increases by 60 feet. </text>		<text>&#8226; You gain proficiency with artisan's tools related to blacksmithing, brewing, and stonemasonry. </text>		<text>Conjure Earth Elemental: If you are holding the axe, you can use your action to cast the conjure elemental spell from it, summoning an earth elemental. You can't use this property again until the next dawn. </text>		<text>Travel the Depths: You can use an action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast the teleport spell from the axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this property again until 3 days have passed. </text>		<text>Curse: The axe bears a curse that affects any non-dwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the creature's physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical changes wrought by the axe aren't considered magical in nature (and therefore can't be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a greater restoration or remove curse spell. </text>		<text>Destroying the Axe: The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the Earthheart Forge, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed.</text>		<text></text>		<text>Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</text>		<text></text>		<text>Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</text>		<text></text>		<text>Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property &#8212; the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</text>		<text />		<text>Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 221</text>		<modifier category="bonus">melee attacks +3</modifier>		<modifier category="bonus">melee damage +3</modifier>		<dmg1>1d8</dmg1>		<dmg2>1d10</dmg2>		<dmgType>S</dmgType>		<property>V, T</property>		<range>20/60</range>	</item>
	<item>		<name>Blackrazor</name>		<type>M</type>		<weight>6</weight>		<text>Requires attunement by a creature of non-lawful alignment</text>		<text></text>		<text>	Hidden in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, Blackrazor shines like a piece of night sky filled with stars. Its black scabbard is decorated with pieces of cut obsidian.</text>		<text>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the following additional properties.</text>		<text>Devour Soul: Whenever you use it to reduce a creature to 0 hit points, the sword slays the creature devours its soul, unless it is a construct or an undead creature whose soul has been devoured by Blackrazor can be restored to life only by a wish spell.</text>		<text>When it devours a soul, Blackrazor grants you temporary hit points equal to the slain creature's hit point maximum. These hit points fade after 24 hours. As long as these temporary hit points last and you keep Blackrazor in hand, you have advantage on attack roll. saving throws, and ability checks.</text>		<text>If you hit an undead with this weapon, you take 1d10 necrotic damage and the target regains 1d10 hit point If this necrotic damage reduces you to 0 hit points, Blackrazor devours your soul.</text>		<text> </text>		<text>Soul Hunter: While you hold the weapon. you are aware of the presence of Tiny or larger creatures within 60 feet of you that aren't constructs or undead. You also can't be charmed or frightened. </text>		<text>Blackrazor can cast the haste spell on you once per day. It decides when to cast the spell and maintains concentration on it so that you don't have to. </text>		<text>Sentience: Blackrazor is a sentient chaotic neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. </text>		<text>The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is deep and echoing. While you are attuned to it, Blackrazor also understands every language you know. </text>		<text>Personality: Blackrazor speaks with an imperious tone, as though accustomed to being obeyed. </text>		<text>The sword's purpose is to consume souls. It doesn't care whose souls it eats, including the wielder's. The word believes that all matter and energy sprang from a void of negative energy and will one day return to it. Blackrazor is meant to hurry that process along.</text>		<text>Despite its nihilism, Blackrazor feels a strange kinship to Wave and Whelm, two other weapons locked away under White Plume Mountain. It wants the three weapons to be united again and wielded together in combat, even though it violently disagrees with Whelm and finds Wave tedious. </text>		<text>Blackrazor's hunger for souls must be regularly fed. If the sword goes three days or more without consuming a soul, a conflict between it and its wielder occurs at the next sunset.</text>		<text></text>		<text>Heavy: Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.</text>		<text></text>		<text>Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use.  When not attacking, you may hold the weapon in one hand.</text>		<text />		<text>Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 216</text>		<modifier category="bonus">melee attacks +3</modifier>		<modifier category="bonus">melee damage +3</modifier>		<dmg1>2d6</dmg1>		<dmg2></dmg2>		<dmgType>S</dmgType>		<property>H,2H</property>		<range></range>	</item>
	<item>		<name>Moonblade</name>		<type>M</type>		<weight>3</weight>		<text>Requires attunement by an elf or half-elf of neutral good alignment</text>		<text></text>		<text>	Of all the magic items created by the elves, one of the most prized and jealously guarded is a moon blade. In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain. </text>		<text>A moonblade passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power. </text>		<text>A moonblade serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the elven gods. </text>		<text>A moon blade won't serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed. </text>		<text>A moonblade has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically 1d6+1). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the moon blade an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on the Moon Blade Properties table.</text>		<text> </text>		<text>MOONBLADE PROPERTIES: </text>		<text>d100 &#8212; Property: </text>		<text>01-40 &#8212; Increase the bonus to attack and damage rolls by 1, to a maximum of +3. Reroll if the moonblade already has a +3 bonus. </text>		<text>41-80 &#8212; The moonblade gains a randomly determined minor property (see "Special Features" earlier in this chapter). </text>		<text>81-82 &#8212; The moonblade gains the finesse property. </text>		<text>83-84 &#8212; The moonblade gains the thrown property (range 20/60 feet). </text>		<text>85-86 &#8212; The moonblade functions as a defender. </text>		<text>87-90 &#8212; The moon blade scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. </text>		<text>91-92 &#8212; When you hit with an attack using the moon blade, the attack an extra 1d6 slashing damage. </text>		<text>93-94 &#8212; When you hit a creature of a specific type (such as dragon, fiend, or undead) with the moonblade, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of one of these types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. </text>		<text>95-96 &#8212; You can use a bonus action to cause the moonblade to flash brightly. Each creature that can see you and is within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can't be used again until you take a short rest while attuned to the weapon. </text>		<text>97-98 &#8212; The moonblade functions as a ring of spell storing. </text>		<text>99 &#8212; You can use an action to call forth an elfshadow, provided that you don't already have one serving you. The elfshadow appears in an unoccupied space within 120 feet of you. It uses the statistics for a shadow from the Monster Manual, except it is neutral, immune to effects that turn undead, and doesn't create new shadows. You control this creature, deciding how it acts and moves. It remains until it drops to 0 hit points or you dismiss it as an action. </text>		<text>00 &#8212; The moonblade functions as a vorpal sword.</text>		<text> </text>		<text>Sentience: A moon blade is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. </text>		<text>The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep. </text>		<text>Personality: Every moonblade seeks the advancement of elvenkind and elven ideals. Courage, loyalty, beauty, music, and life are all part of this purpose. </text>		<text>The weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is absolute. </text>		<text>If a moon blade has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the owner falls short of elven ideals.</text>		<text></text>		<text>Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property &#8212; the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</text>		<text></text>		<text>Blinded:</text>		<text>&#8226; A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.</text>		<text>&#8226; Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.</text>		<text />		<text>Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 217</text>		<modifier category="bonus">melee attacks +1</modifier>		<modifier category="bonus">melee damage +1</modifier>		<dmg1>1d8</dmg1>		<dmg2>1d10</dmg2>		<dmgType>S</dmgType>		<property>V</property>		<range></range>	</item>
	<item>		<name>Sword of Kas</name>		<type>M</type>		<weight>3</weight>		<text>Requires attunement</text>		<text></text>		<text>	When Vecna grew in power, he appointed an evil and ruthless lieutenant, Kas the Bloody Handed, to act as his bodyguard and right hand. This despicable villain served as advisor, warlord, and assassin. His successes earned him Vecna's admiration and a reward: a sword with as dark a pedigree as the man who would wield it. </text>		<text>For a long time, Kas faithfully served the lich but as Kas's power grew, so did his hubris. His sword urged him to supplant Vecna, so that they could rule the lich's empire in Vecna's stead. Legend says Vecna's destruction came at Kas's hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant's doom, leaving only Kas's sword behind. The world was made brighter thereby. </text>		<text>The Sword of Kas is a magic, sentient longsword that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals an extra 2d10 slashing damage to undead. </text>		<text>If the sword isn't bathed in blood within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder take 3d6 psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the dominate monster spell, and the sword demands that it be bathed in blood. The spell effect ends when the sword's demand is met. </text>		<text>Random Properties: The Sword of Kas has the following random properties: </text>		<text>&#8226; 1 minor beneficial property </text>		<text>&#8226; 1 major beneficial property </text>		<text>&#8226; 1 minor detrimental property </text>		<text>&#8226; 1 major detrimental property </text>		<text>Spirit of Kas: While the sword is on your person, you add a d10 to your initiative at the start of every combat. In addition, when you use an action to attack with the sword, you can transfer some or all of its attack bonus to your Armor Class instead. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn. </text>		<text>Spells: While the sword is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save 18) from it: call lightning, divine word, or finger of death. Once you use the sword to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn. </text>		<text>Sentience: The Sword of Kas is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to 2 range of 120 feet. </text>		<text>The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common </text>		<text>Personality: The sword's purpose is to bring ruin to Vecna. Killing Vecna's worshipers, destroying the lich's works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill this goal. </text>		<text>The Sword of Kas also seeks to destroy anyone corrupted by the Eye and Hand of Vecna. The sword's obsession with those artifacts eventually becomes a fixation for its wielder. </text>		<text>Destroying the Sword: A creature attuned to both the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna can use the wish property of those combined artifacts to unmake the Sword of Kas. The creature must cast the wish spell and make a Charisma check contested by the Charisma check of the sword. The sword must be within 30 feet of the creature, or the spell fails. If the sword wins the contest, nothing happens, and the wish spell is wasted. If the sword loses the contest, it is destroyed.</text>		<text></text>		<text>Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands.

	<item>		<name>Wave</name>		<type>M</type>		<weight>4</weight>		<text>Requires attunement by a creature that worships a god of the sea</text>		<text></text>		<text>	Held in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, this trident is an exquisite weapon engraved with images of waves, shells, and sea creatures. Although you must worship a god of the sea to attune to this weapon, Wave happily accepts new converts. </text>		<text>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If you score a critical hit with it, the target takes extra necrotic damage equal to half its hit point maximum. </text>		<text>The weapon also functions as a trident of fish command and a weapon of warning. It can confer the benefit of a cap of water breathing while you hold it, and you can use it as a cube of force by choosing the effect, instead of pressing cube sides to select it. </text>		<text>Sentience: Wave is a sentient weapon of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. </text>		<text>The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Aquan. It can also speak with aquatic animals as if using a speak with animals spell, using telepathy to involve its wielder in the conversation. </text>		<text>Personality: When it grows restless, Wave has a habit of humming tunes that vary from sea chanteys to sacred hymns of the sea gods. </text>		<text>Wave zealously desires to convert mortals to the worship of one or more sea gods, or else to consign the faithless to death. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to </text>		<text>further the weapon's objectives in the world. The trident has a nostalgic attachment to the place where it was forged, a desolate island called Thunderforge. A sea god imprisoned a family of storm giants there, and the giants forged Wave in an act of devotion to- or rebellion against-that god. </text>		<text>Wave harbors a secret doubt about its own nature and purpose. For all its devotion to the sea gods, Wave fears that it was intended to bring about a particular sea god's demise. This destiny is something Wave might not be able to avert.</text>		<text></text>		<text>Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</text>		<text></text>		<text>Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack.

	<item>		<name>Whelm</name>		<type>M</type>		<weight>2</weight>		<text>Requires attunement by a dwarf</text>		<text></text>		<text>	Whelm is a powerful warhammer forged by dwarves and lost in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain. </text>		<text>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. At dawn the day after you first make an attack roll with Whelm, you develop a fear of being outdoors that persists as long as you remain attuned to the weapon. This causes you to have disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks while you can see the daytime sky. </text>		<text>Thrown Weapon: Whelm has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using it, the target takes an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage, or an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage if the target is a giant. Each time you throw the weapon, it flies back to your hand after the attack. If you don't have a hand free, the weapon lands at your feet. </text>		<text>Shock Wave: You can use an action to strike the ground with Whelm and send a shock wave out from the point of impact. Each creature of your choice on the ground within 60 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn. </text>		<text>Supernatural Awareness: While you are holding the weapon, it alerts you to the location of any secret or concealed doors within 30 feet of you. In addition, you can use an action to cast detect evil and good or locate object from the weapon. Once you cast either spell, you can't cast it from the weapon again until the next dawn. </text>		<text>Sentience: Whelm is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. </text>		<text>The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Dwarvish. Giant, and Goblin. It shouts battle cries in Dwarvish when used in combat. </text>		<text>Personality: Whelm's purpose is to slaughter giants and goblinoids. It also seeks to protect dwarves against all enemies. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to destroy goblins and giants or to protect dwarves. Whelm has ties to the dwarf clan that created it, variously called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. It longs to be returned to that clan. It would do anything to protect those dwarves from harm. The hammer also carries a secret shame. Centuries ago, a dwarf named Ctenmiir wielded it valiantly for a time. But Ctenmiir was turned into a vampire. His will was strong enough that he bent Whelm to his evil purposes, even killing members of his own clan.</text>		<text></text>		<text>Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range.

	<item>		<name>Book of Exalted Deeds</name>		<type>W</type>		<weight>5</weight>		<text>Requires attunement by a creature of good alignment</text>		<text></text>		<text>	The definitive treatise on all that is good in the multiverse, the fabled Book of Exalted Deeds figures prominently in many religions. Rather than being a scripture devoted to a particular faith, the book's various authors filled the pages with their own vision of true virtue, providing guidance for defeating evil. </text>		<text>The Book of Exalted Deeds rarely lingers in one place. As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can bring light to a darkened world. Although attempts have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose. </text>		<text>A heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings,. keeps the book's contents secure. Only a creature of good alignment that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain its benefits. Other creatures that peruse the book's open pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. An evil creature that tries to read from the book takes 24d6 radiant damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity, and can't be reduced or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage disappears in a blinding flash and is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind. </text>		<text>Benefits granted by the Book of Exalted Deeds last only as long as you strive to do good. If you fail to perform at least one act of kindness or generosity within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil act, you lose all the benefits granted by the book. </text>		<text>Random Properties: The Book of Exalted Deeds has the following random properties: </text>		<text>&#8226; 2 minor beneficial properties </text>		<text>&#8226; 2 major beneficial properties </text>		<text>Increased Wisdom: After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. You can't gain this benefit from the book more than once. </text>		<text>Enlightened Magic: Once you've read and studied the book, any spell slot you expend to cast a cleric or paladin spell counts as a spell slot of one level higher. </text>		<text>Halo: Once you've read and studied the book, you gain a protective halo. This halo sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a bonus action. While present, the halo gives you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with good creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with evil creatures. In addition, fiends and undead within the halo's bright light make attack rolls against you with disadvantage. </text>		<text>Destroying the Book: It is rumored that the Book of Exalted Deeds can't be destroyed as long as good exists in the multiverse. However, drowning the book in the River Styx removes all writing and imagery from its pages and renders the book powerless for 1d100 years.</text>		<text />		<text>Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 222</text>		<modifier category="ability score">wisdom +2</modifier>	</item>
	<item>		<name>Book of Vile Darkness</name>		<type>W</type>		<weight>5</weight>		<text>Requires attunement</text>		<text></text>		<text>	The contents of this foul manuscript of ineffable wickedness are the meat and drink of those in evil's thrall. No mortal was meant to know the secrets it contains, knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the scrawled pages invites madness. </text>		<text>Most believe the lich-god Vecna authored the Book of Vile Darkness. He recorded in its pages every diseased idea, every unhinged thought, and every example of blackest magic he came across or devised. Vecna covered every vile topic he could, making the book a gruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs. </text>		<text>Other practitioners of evil have held the book and added their own input to its catalog of vile knowledge. Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some cases, made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages are missing, torn. or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches that the original text can't be divined. </text>		<text>Nature can't abide the book's presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence, animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long enough. </text>		<text>A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents and reap its benefits. The creature can then freely modify the book's contents, provided that those modifications advance evil and expand the lore already contained within. </text>		<text>Whenever a non-evil creature attunes to the Book of Vile Darkness, that creature must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment changes to neutral evil. </text>		<text>The Book of Vile Darkness remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears. If you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can't be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned. </text>		<text>Random Properties: The Book of Vile Darkness has the following random properties: </text>		<text>&#8226; 3 minor beneficial properties </text>		<text>&#8226; 1 major beneficial property </text>		<text>&#8226; 3 minor detrimental properties </text>		<text>&#8226; 2 major detrimental properties </text>		<text>Adjusted Ability Scores: After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, one ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can't adjust your ability scores again. </text>		<text>Mark of Darkness: After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, you acquire a physical disfigurement as a hideous sign of your devotion to vile darkness. An evil rune might appear on your face, your eyes might become glossy black, or horns might sprout from your forehead. Or you might become wizened and hideous, lose all facial features, gain a forked tongue, or some other feature the DM chooses. The mark of darkness grants you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with evil creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with non-evil creatures. </text>		<text>Command Evil: While you are attuned to the book and holding it, you can use an action to cast the dominate monster spell on an evil target (save DC 18). You can't use this property again until the next dawn. </text>		<text>Dark Lore: You can reference the Book of Vile Darkness whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about some aspect of evil, such as lore about demons. When you do so, double your proficiency bonus on that check. </text>		<text>Dark Speech: While you carry the Book of Vile Darkness and are attuned to it, you can use an action to recite word from its pages in a foul language known as Dark Speech. Each time you do so, you take 1d12 psychic damage, and each non-evil creature within 15 feet of you takes 3d6 psychic damage. </text>		<text>Destroying the Book: The Book of Vile Darkness allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome. </text>		<text>If a solar tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for 1d100 years, after which it reforms in some dark corner of the multiverse. </text>		<text>A creature attuned to the book for one hundred years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book in a blinding flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book reforms 1d10 x 100 years later. </text>		<text>If all evil in the multiverse is wiped out, the book turns to dust and is forever destroyed.</text>		<text />		<text>Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 222</text>	</item>
	<item>		<name>Eye of Vecna</name>		<type>W</type>		<weight></weight>		<text>Requires attunement</text>		<text></text>		<text>	Seldom is the name of Vecna spoken except in a hushed voice. Vecna was, in his time, one of the mightiest of all wizards. Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn't escape his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever coming about. </text>		<text>Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower. </text>		<text>Some say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One's will in the world. </text>		<text>The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity. </text>		<text>To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die. </text>		<text>To attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die. </text>		<text>Random Properties: The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna each have the following random properties: </text>		<text>&#8226; 1 minor beneficial property </text>		<text>&#8226; 1 major beneficial property </text>		<text>&#8226; 1 minor detrimental property </text>		<text>Properties of the Eye: Your alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits: </text>		<text>&#8226; You have truesight. </text>		<text>&#8226; You can use an action to see as if you were wearing a ring of X-ray vision. You can end this effect as a bonus action. </text>		<text>&#8226; The eye has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: clairvoyance (2 charges), crown of madness (1 charge), disintegrate (4 charges), dominate monster (5 charges), or eyebite (4 charges). The eye regains 1d4+4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the eye, there is a 5 percent chance that Vecna tears your soul from your body, devours it, and then takes control of the body like a puppet. If that happens, you become an NPC under the DM's control. </text>		<text>Properties of the Eye and Hand: If you are attuned to both the hand and eye, you gain the following additional benefits: </text>		<text>&#8226; You are immune to disease and poison. </text>		<text>&#8226; Using the eye's X-ray vision never causes you to suffer exhaustion. </text>		<text>&#8226; You experience premonitions of danger and, unless you are incapacitated, can't be surprised. </text>		<text>&#8226; If you start your turn with at least 1 hit point, you regain 1dl0 hit points. </text>		<text>&#8226; If a creature has a skeleton, you can attempt to turn its bones to jelly with a touch of the Hand of Vecna. You can do so by using an action to make a melee attack against a creature you can reach, using your choice your melee attack bonus for weapons or spells. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points. </text>		<text>&#8226; You can use an action to cast wish. This property can't be used again until 30 days have passed. </text>		<text>Destroying the Eye and Hand: If the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna are both attached to the same creature, and that creature is slain by the Sword of Kas, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed forever. Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the artifact reappears in one of Vecna's many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered.</text>		<text />		<text>Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 224</text>	</item>

	<item>		<name>Orb of Dragonkind</name>		<type>W</type>		<weight></weight>		<text>Requires attunement</text>		<text></text>		<text>	Ages past, on the world of Krynn, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic. </text>		<text>As the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons. </text>		<text>Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb. </text>		<text>An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it. </text>		<text>While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. </text>		<text>While you are charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Takhisis (Tiamat's name on Krynn), or something else the DM decides. </text>		<text>Random Properties: An Orb of Dragon kind has the following random properties: </text>		<text>&#8226; 2 minor beneficial properties </text>		<text>&#8226; 1 minor detrimental property </text>		<text>&#8226; 1 major detrimental property </text>		<text>Spells: The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4+3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: cure wounds (5th-level version, 3 charges), daylight (1 charge), death ward (2 charges), or scrying (3 charges). You can also use an action to cast the detect magic spell from the orb without using any charges. </text>		<text>Call Dragons: While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour. </text>		<text>Destroying an Orb: An Orb of Dragonkind appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A disintegrate spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.</text>		<text />		<text>Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 225</text>	</item>
	<item>		<name>Wand of Orcus</name>		<type>WD</type>		<weight>4</weight>		<text>Requires attunement</text>		<text></text>		<text>	The ghastly Wand of Orcus rarely leaves Orcus's side. The device, as evil as its creator, shares the demon lord's aims to snuff out the lives of all living things and bind the Material Plane in the stasis of undeath. Orcus allows the wand to slip from his grasp from time to time. When it does, it magically appears wherever its master senses an opportunity to achieve some fell goal. </text>		<text>Made from bones as hard as iron, the wand is topped with a magically enlarged skull that once belonged to a human hero slain by Orcus. The wand can magically change in size to better conform to the grip of its user. Plants wither, drinks spoil, flesh rots, and vermin thrive in the wand's presence. </text>		<text>Any creature besides Orcus that tries to attune to the wand must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 necrotic damage. On a failed save, the creature dies and rises as a zombie. </text>		<text>In the hands of one who is attuned to it, the wand can be wielded as a magic mace that grants a+3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The wand deals an extra 2d12 necrotic damage on a hit. </text>		<text>Random Properties: The Wand of Orcus has the following random properties: </text>		<text>&#8226; 2 minor beneficial properties </text>		<text>&#8226; 1 major beneficial property </text>		<text>&#8226; 2 minor detrimental properties </text>		<text>&#8226; 1 major detrimental property </text>		<text>The detrimental properties of the Wand of Orcus are suppressed while the wand is attuned to Orcus himself. </text>		<text>Protection: You gain a +3 bonus to Armor Class while holding the wand. </text>		<text>Spells: The wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: animate dead (1 charge), blight (2 charges), circle of death (3 charges), finger of death (3 charges), power word kill (4 charges), or speak with dead (1 charge). The wand regains 1d4+3 expended charges daily at dawn. </text>		<text>While attuned to the wand, Orcus or a follower blessed by him can cast each of the wand's spells using 2 fewer charges (minimum of 0). </text>		<text>Call Undead: While you are holding the wand, you can use an action to conjure skeletons and zombies, calling forth as many of them as you can divide 500 hit points among, each undead having average hit points (see the Monster Manual for statistics). The undead magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your commands until they are destroyed or until dawn of the next day, when they collapse into inanimate piles of bones and rotting corpses. Once you use this property of the wand, you can't use it again until the next dawn. </text>		<text>While attuned to the wand, Orcus can summon any kind of undead, not just skeletons and zombies. The undead don't perish or disappear at dawn the following day, remaining until Orcus dismisses them. </text>		<text>Sentience: The Wand of Orcus is a sentient, chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. </text>		<text>The wand communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal and Common. </text>		<text>Personality: The wand's purpose is to help satisfy Orcus's desire to slay everything in the multiverse. The wand is cold, cruel, nihilistic, and bereft of humor. In order to further its master's goals, the wand feigns devotion to its current user and makes grandiose promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as vowing to help its user overthrow Orcus. </text>		<text>Destroying the Wand: Destroying the Wand of Orcus requires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life &#8212; no easy task, given the fact that Orcus has imprisoned the hero's soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded. </text>		<text>Bathing the wand in positive energy causes it to crack and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the wand instantly reforms on Orcus's layer of the Abyss.</text>		<text />		<text>Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 227</text>		<modifier category="bonus">melee attacks +3</modifier>		<modifier category="bonus">melee damage +3</modifier>		<modifier category="bonus">ac+3</modifier>	</item>
