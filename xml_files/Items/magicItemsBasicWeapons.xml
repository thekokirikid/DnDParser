If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</text>		<text />		<text>Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 213</text>		<dmg1>0</dmg1>		<dmg2></dmg2>		<dmgType></dmgType>		<property>S,T</property>		<range>5/15</range>	</item>
